# Seller Data Feed Queries

Seller Data Feed Queries utilize Data Feeds to produce data sets similar to those provided by the [Seller Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/Reporting.html) in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal. 

For each type of result data set, we provide queries using both bi-temporal data from the Data Feeds.

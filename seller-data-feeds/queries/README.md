# Seller Data Feed Queries

Seller Data Feed Queries utilize Data Feeds to produce data sets similar to those provided by the [Seller Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/Reporting.html) in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal. 

For each type of result data set, we maybe provide queries using both bi-temporal and uni-temporal data.
* The Data Feeds provide bi-temporal data. Thus, if the query is done using the Data Feeds data, users must use the __bi-temporal__ query.
* If the data from the Data Feed has been transformed to be uni-temporal while being loaded to a BI tool or database, users should use the __uni-temporal__ query.
